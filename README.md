There are currently three classes implemented in this RPG: Archer, Gladiator and Knight.
The protagonist starts out with base stats of 250 HP, 20-65 Strength, 40 Defense and an attack rating of 0.4, which affects the damage done.
Picking a class modifies certain stats or abilities, but the player can choose to remain a Peasant and do not modify any.

Players can choose to use special attacks. Each will decrease your defense by 5 and increases your strength by 15, until you use a normal attack.

The Archer class has an attack rating of 0.7, and the strength increased by strength is increased to 25.
The Gladiator class starts with 40-85 Strength and an attack rating of 0.5.
The Knight class starts with 300 HP and 55 Defense.
